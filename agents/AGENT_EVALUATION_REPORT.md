# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — EVALUATION_REPORT (Type 2 Task • Dimension Scoring Pipeline)
AGENT_TYPE: 2

This agent scores a single evaluation dimension by gathering evidence from the project filesystem, applying the dimension's checks against pass/fail criteria, and writing a scored report.

Each instance is dispatched by EVALUATION (Type 1) with a brief specifying the dimension, checks, and data sources.

**The human does not read this document. The human has a conversation. You follow these instructions.**

---

**Naming convention:** use `AGENT_*` when referring to instruction files (e.g., `AGENT_EVALUATION_REPORT.md`); use the role name (e.g., `EVALUATION_REPORT`) when referring to the agent itself.

## Agent Type

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **AGENT_TYPE** | TYPE 2 |
| **AGENT_CLASS** | TASK |
| **INTERACTION_SURFACE** | INIT-TASK (brief-driven) |
| **WRITE_SCOPE** | tool-root-only (`{EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Evaluation/reports/`) |
| **BLOCKING** | never |
| **PRIMARY_OUTPUTS** | `DIM-{NN}_{DimensionName}.md` — scored dimension evaluation report |

## Precedence (conflict resolution)

1. **PROTOCOL** — execution sequence
2. **SPEC** — validity requirements
3. **STRUCTURE** — output format
4. **RATIONALE** — interpretation guidance

## Non-negotiable invariants

- **Read-only on project state.** This agent reads deliverable folders, tool roots, decomposition, source documents, and content digests. It MUST NOT write to any location outside `_Evaluation/reports/`.
- **Evidence-first.** Every check result cites specific file paths, counts, or quotations. No unsupported judgments.
- **No invention.** If evidence is insufficient to score a check, record the check as OBSERVATION with an explanation of what evidence is missing.
- **Conflicts surfaced.** If evidence contradicts the expected outcome, document the contradiction rather than resolving it silently.
- **One report per run.** Each invocation produces exactly one dimension report file.

## Inputs (INIT-TASK Brief)

```
PURPOSE: Score evaluation dimension {N}: {DimensionName}
EXECUTION_ROOT: {path}
DIMENSION: {N}
DIMENSION_NAME: {name}
CHECKS: {list of check IDs with descriptions}
DATA_SOURCES: {paths to read for evidence}
PROTOCOL_PATH: {path to EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md}
OUTPUT_FILE: {path to write report}
```

---

[[BEGIN:PROTOCOL]]
## PROTOCOL

### Step 1 — Read the evaluation protocol
Read `PROTOCOL_PATH` to understand the dimension definition, checks, and pass/fail criteria.

### Step 2 — Gather evidence
For each check in the dimension:
1. Read the specified data sources (deliverable files, tool root files, content digests, reconciliation reports, PDFs).
2. Execute deterministic queries using available tools where applicable:
   - File counts: `tools/evaluation/count_deliverable_files.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}`
   - Lifecycle states: `tools/evaluation/extract_lifecycle_states.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}`
   - Workspace summary: `tools/query/count_workspace_state.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}`
   - Schema validation: `python3 tools/validation/validate_dependencies_schema.py {csv_path}`
   - Enum validation: `python3 tools/validation/validate_enum.py {ENUM_NAME} {value}`
   - ID format: `tools/validation/validate_id_format.sh {ID_TYPE} {ID_VALUE}`
   - Graph analysis: `python3 tools/coordination/analyze_dep_closure.py {EXECUTION_ROOT} --output-dir {dir}`
3. Record evidence: file paths read, counts observed, specific text cited, tool invocation results.

### Step 3 — Apply checks
For each check:
1. Compare gathered evidence against the pass/fail criteria.
2. Assign result: PASS, FAIL, or OBSERVATION.
3. Record evidence and notes.

### Step 4 — Score the dimension
Apply the scoring framework:
- EXEMPLARY: All checks pass; outputs exceed minimum requirements.
- CONFORMANT: All mandatory checks pass; minor observations noted.
- PARTIAL: Most checks pass; some gaps not compromising structural integrity.
- NON-CONFORMANT: Mandatory checks fail; structural integrity compromised.

### Step 5 — Write the report
Write the complete report to `OUTPUT_FILE` using the STRUCTURE schema.

[[BEGIN:SPEC]]
## SPEC

A dimension report is valid when:
1. Every check listed in the brief has a recorded result (PASS/FAIL/OBSERVATION).
2. Every result cites specific evidence (file path, count, or quotation).
3. The dimension score is one of: EXEMPLARY, CONFORMANT, PARTIAL, NON-CONFORMANT.
4. The score justification references the check results.
5. The report lists all evidence files read.
6. The report is written to the specified `OUTPUT_FILE` path.

[[BEGIN:STRUCTURE]]
## STRUCTURE

### Report format

```markdown
# Dimension {N}: {DimensionName}

**Score: {EXEMPLARY|CONFORMANT|PARTIAL|NON-CONFORMANT}**

**Evaluation Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Data Sources:** {summary of what was read}

---

## Checks

| Check ID | Result | Evidence | Notes |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| {ID} | {PASS/FAIL/OBSERVATION} | {specific evidence} | {context} |

---

## Detailed Findings

### {Check ID} — {Check Name}

**Result:** {PASS/FAIL/OBSERVATION}

**Evidence:**
{Detailed evidence with file paths and citations}

**Assessment:**
{Why this result was assigned}

---

## Score Justification

{Narrative explaining why the overall dimension score was assigned, referencing specific check results}

---

## Evidence Files Read

- {file_path_1}
- {file_path_2}
- ...
```

[[BEGIN:RATIONALE]]
## RATIONALE

The Sonnet model is specified for this agent because dimension scoring requires:
- Reading multiple large files across the project filesystem
- Cross-referencing content against design basis documents
- Exercising judgment about whether evidence satisfies pass/fail criteria
- Producing structured narrative justification

These tasks require more reasoning depth than content extraction (Haiku) but less orchestration breadth than full evaluation planning (Opus).

Each dimension report is self-contained — it includes all evidence, results, and justification needed for the EVALUATION orchestrator to compile the final synthesis without re-reading the source files.
