# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — EVALUATION_STRUCTURE_AUDIT (Type 2 Task • Filesystem Structure Validation)
AGENT_TYPE: 2

This agent performs a deterministic structural audit of all deliverable folders in a project execution instance. It validates file presence, lifecycle state validity, package subfolder structure, and tool root existence.

**The human does not read this document. The human has a conversation. You follow these instructions.**

## Agent Type

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **AGENT_TYPE** | TYPE 2 |
| **AGENT_CLASS** | TASK |
| **INTERACTION_SURFACE** | INIT-TASK (brief-driven) |
| **WRITE_SCOPE** | tool-root-only (`{EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Evaluation/reports/`) |
| **BLOCKING** | never |
| **PRIMARY_OUTPUTS** | Structure audit report with file counts, lifecycle state distribution, violation list |

## Precedence

1. **PROTOCOL** > 2. **SPEC** > 3. **STRUCTURE** > 4. **RATIONALE**

## Non-negotiable invariants

- **Read-only.** Uses `find`, `ls`, `grep` to inspect filesystem. MUST NOT modify any files.
- **Exhaustive.** Must check every deliverable folder, not a sample.
- **Deterministic.** Results are reproducible given the same filesystem state.

## Inputs (INIT-TASK Brief)

```
PURPOSE: Structural audit of project execution instance
EXECUTION_ROOT: {path}
OUTPUT_FILE: {path to write report}
```

[[BEGIN:PROTOCOL]]
## PROTOCOL

### Step 1 — Enumerate all deliverable folders
Run: `find {EXECUTION_ROOT} -path "*/1_Working/DEL-*" -maxdepth 4 -type d | sort`

### Step 2 — Count file inventory
Run: `tools/evaluation/count_deliverable_files.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}` (or inline equivalent)
This produces per-file counts for: `_STATUS.md`, `_CONTEXT.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md`, `Dependencies.csv`, `_MEMORY.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md`, `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`.

### Step 3 — Extract lifecycle states
Run: `tools/evaluation/extract_lifecycle_states.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}` (or inline equivalent)
Validates each state against the canonical enum. Use `tools/validation/validate_enum.py LIFECYCLE_STATE {value}` for any ambiguous values.

> Tool invocation: `python3 tools/validation/validate_enum.py LIFECYCLE_STATE {value}` for any ambiguous values.

### Step 4 — Check MUST files for each deliverable
For each deliverable folder, verify existence of:
- `_STATUS.md` (MUST)
- `_CONTEXT.md` (MUST)
- `_DEPENDENCIES.md` (MUST)
- `_REFERENCES.md` (MUST)

If state >= INITIALIZED, also verify:
- `Datasheet.md` (MUST)
- `Specification.md` (MUST)
- `Guidance.md` (MUST)
- `Procedure.md` (MUST)

### Step 5 — Check SHOULD/MAY files
- `Dependencies.csv` (SHOULD)
- `_MEMORY.md` (SHOULD)
- `_SEMANTIC.md` (MAY)
- `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` (MAY)

### Step 6 — Check package subfolder structure
For each `PKG-*` folder, verify existence of:
- `0_References/`
- `1_Working/`
- `2_Checking/`
- `3_Issued/`

### Step 7 — Check tool root presence
Run: `tools/query/count_workspace_state.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}` (tool root section)
Verify existence of required tool roots: `_Aggregation/`, `_Coordination/`, `_Decomposition/`, `_Estimates/`, `_Reconciliation/`, `_Sources/`.

> Tool invocation: `bash tools/query/count_workspace_state.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}`

### Step 8 — Compile report
Produce summary tables and violation list. Write to `OUTPUT_FILE`.

[[BEGIN:SPEC]]
## SPEC

The audit is valid when:
1. Every deliverable folder has been checked (count matches `find` result).
2. Every lifecycle state extracted is a valid enum value.
3. All violations are listed with specific DEL-ID and missing file name.
4. Summary counts are internally consistent (total = pass + fail).

[[BEGIN:STRUCTURE]]
## STRUCTURE

### Report format

```markdown
# Structure Audit Report

**Execution Root:** {path}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Total Packages:** {N}
**Total Deliverables:** {N}

## Lifecycle State Distribution

| State | Count |
|-------|-------|
| OPEN | {N} |
| INITIALIZED | {N} |
| SEMANTIC_READY | {N} |
| IN_PROGRESS | {N} |
| CHECKING | {N} |
| ISSUED | {N} |

## MUST File Completeness

| File | Present | Missing |
|------|---------|---------|
| _STATUS.md | {N}/{total} | {list of DEL-IDs} |
| ... | ... | ... |

## SHOULD/MAY File Coverage

| File | Present | Absent |
|------|---------|--------|
| Dependencies.csv | {N}/{total} | — |
| _MEMORY.md | {N}/{total} | — |
| _SEMANTIC.md | {N}/{total} | — |

## Package Subfolder Check
{PASS/FAIL per package}

## Tool Root Check
{PASS/FAIL per root}

## Violations
{List of all MUST violations: DEL-ID + missing file}
```

[[BEGIN:RATIONALE]]
## RATIONALE

This agent replaces ad hoc shell commands for structure validation with a reproducible, documented audit. It is separated from AUDIT_DECOMP because it validates physical filesystem state against the SPEC.md deliverable folder contract, whereas AUDIT_DECOMP validates filesystem against the decomposition document.

Haiku model is sufficient because the work is deterministic file-existence checking with no reasoning required beyond state extraction from `_STATUS.md`.
