# Verification and Validation Strategy

## 1. Principle

Verification proves that the software solves the stated mechanics problem correctly within declared tolerances. Validation evaluates whether the software workflow is fit for its intended engineering support role. Neither replaces project-specific professional judgment.

## 2. Benchmark families

| Family | Examples | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Units and schemas | dimensional conversions, invalid unit rejection, schema completeness | automated tests |
| Frame mechanics | cantilever, fixed-fixed thermal growth, portal frame, inclined member transforms | hand calculations and automated comparisons |
| Piping loads | weight, pressure thrust where modeled, imposed displacement, thermal expansion | hand calculations and regression outputs |
| Stress recovery | axial, bending, torsion, pressure membrane, stress range | hand calculations |
| Nonlinear supports | one-way support, gap, lift-off, friction active state | convergence and state trace |
| Rule packs | invented demo values, missing required inputs, unit mismatch, unsafe expression | evaluator tests |
| Reports | reproducibility, checksum stability, warning inclusion, protected-content lint | report tests |

The initial mechanics benchmark suite for `DEL-09-01` lives under
`validation/benchmarks/mechanics/` with hand-calculation notes under
`validation/hand_calcs/mechanics/`. Its required fixture families are
cantilever, frame, thermal growth, imposed displacement, and stiffness
transform. The fixtures use original invented values and keep final release
tolerances, CI gates, and professional reliance policy as `TBD` until human
approval.

The initial stress recovery benchmark suite for `DEL-09-02` lives under
`validation/benchmarks/stress/` with hand-calculation notes under
`validation/hand_calcs/stress/`. Its required fixture families are axial
normal stress, bending normal stress, torsional shear stress, pressure membrane
stress, and mechanics-only stress range. The fixtures use original invented
values and keep final release tolerances, CI gates, fatigue/allowable
criteria, and professional reliance policy as `TBD` until human approval.

## 3. Validation manual structure

The validation manual skeleton lives at `docs/validation_manual/index.md`. It
is a draft evidence-organization surface for maintainers and reviewers; it is
not an engineering seal, code-compliance ruling, or project-specific reliance
record.

The validation manual shall include these sections:

1. product scope and limitations;
2. solver theory summary;
3. unit and schema verification;
4. element verification;
5. load and stress recovery verification;
6. nonlinear support verification;
7. rule-pack evaluator verification;
8. GUI workflow validation;
9. report reproducibility validation;
10. known limitations and open issues.

Each section must state whether it is verification evidence, workflow
validation evidence, user-rule-check evidence, or professional-reliance context.
Missing evidence, unapproved thresholds, and unresolved source/provenance
questions remain explicit `TBD` items until a governed decision or evidence
record exists.

## 4. Release gate

A release candidate must not be labeled engineering beta unless:

- all required mechanics benchmarks pass;
- stress-recovery benchmarks pass;
- rule-pack missing-input tests pass;
- report reproducibility tests pass;
- protected-content lint passes for public examples/templates;
- open risks are listed and accepted by human maintainers.

## 5. Benchmark source rule

Validation examples must be original, public-domain, or permissively licensed.
Protected code examples and commercial software examples are not acceptable
unless written permission is documented.

Each public mechanics benchmark fixture must record source/provenance,
redistribution status, contributor or generator note, assumptions, units,
expected result fields, and review disposition before it is treated as accepted
public validation evidence.

Each public stress recovery benchmark fixture must follow the same provenance
rule and must remain limited to open mechanics component comparisons. Stress
range fixtures are mechanics differences between result states; they are not
fatigue checks, allowable comparisons, code compliance checks, or professional
approval records.
