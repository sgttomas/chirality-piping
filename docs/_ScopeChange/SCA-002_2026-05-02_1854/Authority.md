## Design Basis

SCA-002 admits PRD v0.2 as the working product-design basis for OpenPipeStress. The amendment changes the product framing from a narrower open piping stress analysis platform toward an analysis-grade piping design engine and stress-model authoring environment with a full internal solver, schema-backed physical model, immutable model states, analysis runs, deterministic comparison, and handoff packages.

The PRD v0.2 basis does not reduce solver seriousness. It preserves the full analytical engine, open mechanics/private code-data boundary, unit safety, rule-pack structure, validation discipline, local-first posture, and professional responsibility boundary.

## Authority Boundary

This docs-side record is authoritative for the SCA-002 product-design basis. The execution-side snapshot records operational evidence, amendment actions, impact assessment, propagation plan, and handoff state.

SCA-002 does not directly refresh downstream deliverable production documents, DAG files, implementation evidence, lifecycle states, dependency registers, or package-local artifacts. Those surfaces are stale relative to revision 0.5 until refreshed by their owning workflows.
