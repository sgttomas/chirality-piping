# Local-First Storage Policy

This policy defines OpenPipeStress local-first storage and private path posture
for `DEL-12-01`. It is a privacy and product-boundary artifact, not a runtime
storage implementation, filesystem layout, project package/container choice,
cloud-service design, encryption claim, secret storage design, professional
engineering approval, security certification, compliance attestation, or claim
that analysis results are fit for reliance without competent human review.

## Scope

OpenPipeStress is local-first by default. Private project models, private rule
packs, private material and component libraries, owner standards, company
design bases, credentials, secrets, diagnostics, reports, generated outputs,
and other user-owned engineering data remain user controlled unless a user
intentionally exports, shares, contributes, or attaches them with documented
rights.

The public repository is not a default durable storage location for private
project, rule-pack, material, component, report, diagnostic, owner-standard,
credential, secret, or proprietary data.

Cloud storage, cloud sync, and cloud service behavior are out of MVP unless
separately approved by the human project authority. Telemetry remains disabled
by default and must not become a storage or synchronization path.

## Storage Resolution Rules

Storage choices must fail closed. Absent, unknown, unresolved, ambiguous, or
unsupported storage choices remain explicit `TBD`, warning, or finding states
rather than silent defaults.

The exact physical project package/container, operating-system roots,
application data directories, migration framework, encryption, secret storage,
key management, redaction workflow, import/export formats, cloud exception
workflow, and runtime storage implementation remain `TBD` unless separately
approved.

This policy does not create real private paths, write files, define a product
configuration schema, or select storage roots.

## Symbolic Path Classes

Until implementation selects concrete roots, storage planning uses symbolic
path classes only.

| Symbolic class | Default sensitivity | Boundary rule |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC_REPOSITORY_CONTENT` | Public-reviewed | May contain source code, schemas, blank templates, governance docs, and invented examples after protected-content review. |
| `PUBLIC_EXAMPLE_CONTENT` | Public-reviewed | May contain invented examples or public-permissive content with provenance and review disposition. |
| `USER_CHOSEN_PROJECT_PACKAGE` | Private by default | Holds user project model data and project-local assets in a user-controlled location; physical container remains `TBD`. |
| `USER_PRIVATE_LIBRARY_ROOT` | Private by default | Holds user-controlled material, component, section, and owner/library data outside public repository paths. |
| `USER_PRIVATE_RULE_PACK_ROOT` | Private by default | Holds private rule packs, source notices, checksums, and redistribution status outside public repository paths. |
| `USER_REPORT_OUTPUT_ROOT` | Private by default | Holds reports, screenshots, review exports, and generated outputs selected by the user. |
| `USER_DIAGNOSTIC_BUNDLE_ROOT` | Private by default | Holds diagnostics/support bundles only after explicit user review of attachments and contents. |
| `USER_IMPORT_STAGING_ROOT` | Private or provenance-gated | Holds imported files pending validation, provenance capture, redistribution review, and protected-content checks. |
| `USER_EXPORT_STAGING_ROOT` | Private or review-gated | Holds export payloads pending redaction/export controls and explicit user action. |
| `LOCAL_CACHE_ROOT` | Private by default | Holds derived local cache data; cache contents must not become public artifacts by default. |
| `USER_SECRET_REFERENCE` | Secret reference only | Represents a pointer to future secret handling; actual secret storage is owned by `DEL-12-04` and remains `TBD`. |

These names are planning classes, not filesystem paths. They must not be
interpreted as operating-system roots, repository directories, cloud locations,
or default user paths.

## Repository Leakage Prohibitions

Public repository paths must not be used as default durable storage for:

- project geometry, loads, supports, load cases, solve results, or project
  package payloads;
- private rule packs, owner standards, company design bases, rule formulas,
  thresholds, inputs, or evaluation results;
- private material, component, section, or vendor-derived library values;
- generated reports, screenshots, review exports, support bundles, diagnostics,
  or local cache payloads;
- model hashes, manifest hashes, report hashes, rule-pack hashes, or private-
  library hashes that can fingerprint private work;
- tokens, passwords, API keys, license keys, certificates, private keys,
  signing keys, cookies, authorization headers, or other secrets;
- protected standards text, copied examples, copied formulas, standards tables,
  proprietary engineering values, commercial benchmark content, or protected/
  code-derived content.

Contribution workflows may accept public examples or data only after source,
provenance, license or redistribution status, contributor certification, and
review disposition are recorded.

## Persistence Baseline

Local-first storage must preserve the project persistence baseline:

- versioned persistence;
- schema-governed payloads;
- unit-aware data where quantities are present;
- provenance-preserving records;
- migration-aware status;
- deterministic round-trip serialization;
- canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hashes where JSON payloads are hashed;
- explicit findings for missing storage, privacy, provenance, redistribution,
  migration, or validation decisions.

The physical project package/container remains `TBD`; this policy does not
choose between a single package, directory tree, database, archive format, or
other storage container.

## No-Bypass Surfaces

The private/public path classification and local-first rules apply equally to
first-party code, plugins, adapters, import/export paths, reports, telemetry,
CLI runners, diagnostics, tests, private-library mechanisms, future
application services, and support bundle workflows.

future application services must use the same private/public path
classification and local-first rules.

No plugin manifest, adapter declaration, CLI option, imported file, report
template, rule pack, telemetry setting, diagnostic setting, or environment
default can bypass:

- path classification;
- unit checks and dimensional checks;
- provenance checks and redistribution status;
- protected-content screening;
- private-data controls;
- diagnostics and result-envelope warning classes;
- rule-pack sandboxing;
- report/export controls;
- human acceptance boundaries.

## Diagnostics And Reports

Storage diagnostics, if added later, must identify unresolved or unsafe storage
states without printing private payload contents. A diagnostic may state that a
path class is unresolved, private, public-review-required, export-review-
required, or blocked, but it must not reveal private values or secrets.

Reports and exports remain user-controlled private outputs by default. `DEL-12-02`
owns redaction and export controls and should consume this policy's symbolic
path-class vocabulary.

## Open Decisions

| Decision | Current state |
|---|---|
| Physical project package/container | `TBD`; this policy defines symbolic path classes only. |
| Operating-system roots and application data directories | `TBD`; no OS-specific root or real user path is selected. |
| Migration framework and concrete persistence service | `TBD`; versioned, migration-aware persistence remains the baseline. |
| Encryption, secret storage, and key management | `TBD`; no encryption or secret-storage claim is made here. |
| Redaction workflow and export staging behavior | `TBD`; owned downstream by `DEL-12-02`. |
| Private-library registry and secret/private-library handling | `TBD`; owned downstream by `DEL-12-04`. |
| Import/export formats and adapter behavior | `TBD`; no adapter behavior is authorized here. |
| Cloud exception workflow | `TBD`; cloud storage, cloud sync, and cloud service behavior are out of MVP unless separately approved. |

## Verification Expectations

Local-first storage policy and future implementation changes should be checked
for:

- traceability to `DEL-12-01`, `PKG-12`, `SOW-029`, and `OBJ-010`;
- local-first, user-controlled defaults for private project, rule-pack,
  material/component library, report, diagnostic, generated output, credential,
  secret, owner-standard, and proprietary data;
- prohibition on public repository paths as default durable storage for private
  data;
- symbolic path classes instead of real paths, OS-specific roots, cloud
  locations, or user-specific examples;
- explicit `TBD`, warning, or finding states for unresolved storage choices;
- preservation of versioned, schema-governed, provenance-preserving,
  migration-aware, round-trip testable persistence;
- no-bypass rules for plugins, adapters, import/export, reports, telemetry,
  CLI, diagnostics, tests, and application services;
- absence of protected standards content, proprietary engineering values, real
  private project data, real secrets, real filesystem paths, cloud storage
  commitments, encryption claims, and professional/code-compliance or security-
  certification claims.
