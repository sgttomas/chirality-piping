# Security Threat Model

This threat model records OpenPipeStress security and privacy risks for private
data, report sharing, plugins, imports, local-first storage boundaries,
telemetry, secrets, and supply chain exposure.

This document is a project security planning artifact. It is not legal advice,
professional engineering approval, certification, a security certification, a
compliance attestation, or a claim that any analysis result is fit for reliance
without competent human review.

## Scope

OpenPipeStress is local-first by default. Private project data, private rule
packs, private material and component libraries, owner standards, company
design bases, diagnostics, reports, and secrets remain user controlled unless a
user intentionally exports, shares, contributes, or attaches them with
documented rights.

Cloud operation is out of MVP unless separately approved. Telemetry is disabled
by default and must not transmit private engineering or code data unless a user
explicitly chooses a payload.

## Assets

| Asset | Sensitivity | Boundary expectation |
|---|---|---|
| Project files and model data | Private by default | Stored in user-controlled paths; not committed or exported publicly by default. |
| Rule packs | Private/user-owned by default | May include proprietary or licensed design-basis content; public examples must be invented or reviewed. |
| Material and component libraries | Private or provenance-gated | Public records require source, license, redistribution status, contributor certification, and review disposition. |
| Reports and result exports | Disclosure-sensitive | May expose project values, assumptions, warnings, source notes, and private rule/library identifiers. |
| Diagnostics, logs, and bug reports | Disclosure-sensitive | Must avoid automatic inclusion of private project files, paths, rule content, or calculation results. |
| Plugin and adapter manifests | Security-sensitive | Requests entrypoints, permissions, privacy posture, checksums, sandbox requirements, and no-bypass controls. |
| Import/export and local FEA handoff data | Disclosure-sensitive | Must preserve validation, units, provenance, diagnostics, public/private data boundaries, and report controls. |
| Secrets and credentials | Secret | Must not appear in project files, reports, logs, examples, tests, or public artifacts. |
| Build and release artifacts | Supply-chain-sensitive | Require provenance, integrity, dependency review, and release-gate evidence. |

## Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Risk | Required posture |
|---|---|---|
| Local filesystem | Private files may be placed near public examples or repository paths. | Keep public examples separate from private paths; warn when export or contribution paths may disclose private data. |
| Public repository | Protected standards content, proprietary data, private projects, or secrets could be committed. | Apply provenance, protected-content, private-data, and secret-review gates before public contribution. |
| Report/export/share | Reports, exports, screenshots, shared models, or copied values may disclose private or protected data. | Require explicit user action, warnings, redaction controls where available, and public-template protected-content review. |
| Bug reports and diagnostics | Logs or attachments may disclose file paths, project names, values, private rule-pack metadata, or private libraries. | Default to redacted diagnostics; require explicit attachment review for project files or private payloads. |
| Telemetry | Operational metrics can become sensitive when tied to engineering work. | Keep telemetry off by default; opt-in only; exclude private engineering/code data unless the user explicitly chooses the payload. |
| Plugin/import/export/FEA handoff | Extensions or adapters may bypass validation, provenance, diagnostics, sandboxing, or report controls. | Enforce no-bypass constraints through schemas, manifests, diagnostics, and review gates. |
| Rule evaluator | User rule logic may be private and evaluator execution must not become arbitrary code execution. | Use sandboxed, deterministic, unit-aware evaluation; carry checksums, private/public markings, and source notices. |
| Build and release supply chain | Dependencies, plugins, build tools, or release packages may be compromised or provenance-weak. | Require dependency/license/provenance review, reproducible build evidence where available, artifact integrity checks, and release gates. |

## Threat Inventory

| ID | Surface | Threat | Initial risk | Required controls or open decisions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| STM-001 | Local storage | Private project, rule-pack, material, component, or owner-standard data is stored in a public/example path or committed accidentally. | High | Private-path conventions, public/example exclusion, contribution review, protected-content checks, private-data checks, and `IP_BOUNDARY_WARNING` diagnostics. |
| STM-002 | Report/export/share | A report, shared model, result export, screenshot, or copied table discloses private values or protected code-derived content. | High | Redaction workflow `TBD`, export warnings, public-template protected-content review, provenance summaries, and explicit user action. |
| STM-003 | Bug reports | A diagnostic bundle or issue attachment includes private project files, rule packs, libraries, paths, or calculation results. | High | Redacted default bundles `TBD`, attachment review, telemetry exclusion, and explicit user attachment. |
| STM-004 | Telemetry | Optional telemetry transmits private project data, rule-pack data, library data, or calculation results. | High | Disabled by default, opt-in only, no private engineering/code data, explicit payload selection if private data is ever included. |
| STM-005 | Plugins and adapters | A plugin, scripting API, importer, exporter, or FEA handoff bypasses validation, units, provenance, privacy controls, sandboxing, diagnostics, or report controls. | High | Deny-by-default plugin posture, manifest validation, permission model `TBD`, sandboxing where execution exists, and no-bypass enforcement. |
| STM-006 | Imports and contributions | Imported data lacks provenance or appears copied from protected standards, vendor catalogs, or proprietary sources. | High | Required provenance fields, redistribution status, contributor certification, review disposition, quarantine for protected-suspected content, and human/legal review. |
| STM-007 | Rule evaluator | Rule expressions execute arbitrary code or leak private rule contents through diagnostics, reports, or exports. | High | Sandboxed evaluator, deterministic expression model, no file/network/process access, private/public marking, checksums, and redacted reporting. |
| STM-008 | Public examples | Public examples or tests include realistic values copied from protected standards, vendors, commercial software, or private projects. | High | Invented or public-permissive examples only, source/provenance records, protected-content review, and rejection/quarantine where rights are unclear. |
| STM-009 | Secrets | Tokens, passwords, license credentials, private-library credentials, or signing keys appear in project files, reports, logs, examples, or tests. | High | Secret storage policy `TBD`, secret scanning `TBD`, report/export exclusion, and no real secrets in public artifacts. |
| STM-010 | Hash/provenance spoofing | Checksums, source notices, or review records do not bind to the actual payload being reviewed or exported. | Medium/High | Canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hash basis for JSON payloads, manifest hashes for non-JSON assets, and re-review after content changes. |
| STM-011 | Build and release supply chain | Dependencies, plugin packages, build scripts, or release artifacts are compromised, unlicensed, or provenance-weak. | Medium/High | Dependency and license review, release quality gates, artifact checksums/signing `TBD`, reproducible build evidence `TBD`, and protected-content gates. |
| STM-012 | Authority overclaim | Reports, diagnostics, UI text, examples, or security documentation imply code compliance, professional approval, or security certification. | Medium/High | Professional-boundary review, report notices, prohibited-claim scans, and human acceptance records that bind only to specific content hashes where used. |

## No-Bypass Controls

Plugins, adapters, importers, exporters, FEA handoff paths, report generators,
and automation runners must preserve the same controls as first-party code:

- schema validation;
- unit checks and dimensional checks;
- provenance checks and redistribution status;
- privacy and private-data controls;
- protected-content screening;
- diagnostics and result-envelope warning classes;
- rule-pack sandboxing;
- report boundaries and professional-boundary notices;
- solver and mechanics/rule-check separation;
- human acceptance boundaries.

A plugin manifest or adapter declaration grants nothing by itself. Runtime
permission model, loader mechanics, external API transport, and concrete
import/export format list remain `TBD`.

## Report And Export Rules

Public report templates and public examples must not include protected
standards text, copied formulas, standards tables, proprietary standards
content, commercial benchmark material, real private project data, real private
rule content, real private library values, or secrets.

Reports may reference a user rule-pack ID, version, checksum, source note,
warnings, assumptions, and limitations. Private report templates remain the
user's responsibility and must not be treated as public project content unless
they pass contribution review.

## Telemetry Rules

Telemetry is disabled by default. If telemetry is introduced later, it must be
opt-in and privacy-preserving. It must not transmit private project files,
material data, component data, rule packs, owner standards, company design
bases, calculation results, report payloads, or protected/code-derived content
unless a user explicitly chooses that payload.

Telemetry implementation details, event schema, consent UI, retention policy,
and review gates remain `TBD`.

## Supply Chain Rules

Build, packaging, dependency, and release workflows must treat dependency
source, license status, package integrity, generated artifacts, and release
notes as security-relevant evidence. Release artifacts should carry hashes or
other integrity records once the release process is selected.

Dependency-version policy, signing process, reproducible build target,
publisher identity, CI provider, and coverage thresholds remain `TBD`.

## Open Decisions

| Decision | Current state |
|---|---|
| Private project package/container format | `TBD`; canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hash basis applies where JSON payloads are hashed. |
| Encryption for private rule packs or libraries | `TBD`; no default encryption claim is made here. |
| Secret storage and signing-key process | `TBD`; real secrets are prohibited in public artifacts. |
| Plugin permission model and loader mechanics | `TBD`; no-bypass and deny-by-default posture applies. |
| Public API transport and supported import/export formats | `TBD`; schema-first envelopes remain the architecture basis. |
| Redaction workflow and bug-report bundle format | `TBD`; default posture is redacted and explicit user attachment. |
| Telemetry event schema and consent workflow | `TBD`; telemetry remains off by default. |
| Dependency signing/reproducible build/release integrity process | `TBD`; release evidence must be selected before release reliance. |

## Review Triggers

Review and update this threat model when any of these change:

- public API transport, plugin permission model, or import/export format list;
- physical project package/container, migration, encryption, or key-management
  choices;
- rule expression grammar, parser, or sandbox implementation;
- telemetry introduction or event schema changes;
- report/export fields, templates, copy paths, screenshots, or shared-model
  package behavior;
- private-library storage, secret handling, or credential workflows;
- build/package/release signing, dependency review, or CI policy;
- any protected-content, private-data, secret, or supply-chain incident.

## Verification Expectations

Threat-model changes should be checked for:

- traceability to `DEL-12-05`, `PKG-12`, `SOW-040`, and `OBJ-010`;
- coverage of required assets, trust boundaries, and threat rows;
- preservation of local-first, telemetry-off-by-default, and no-bypass
  constraints;
- explicit `TBD` markers for unresolved implementation choices;
- absence of protected standards content, proprietary engineering values, real
  private project data, real secrets, and professional/code-compliance or
  security-certification claims.
