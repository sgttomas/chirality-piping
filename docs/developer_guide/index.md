# OpenPipeStress Developer Guide

This guide is for contributors extending the solver, rule-pack, report, and
adapter surfaces of OpenPipeStress. It is documentation for the public project;
it does not define protected rule content, private design bases, legal rights,
or professional engineering acceptance.

OpenPipeStress keeps three responsibilities separate:

- the open solver computes code-neutral mechanics;
- user-supplied rule packs evaluate user-defined acceptability checks;
- professional use remains a human responsibility outside automatic software
  output.

## 1. Governing Artifacts

Read these project artifacts before changing solver or rule-pack behavior:

| Artifact | Use |
|---|---|
| [`docs/CONTRACT.md`](../CONTRACT.md) | Binding invariants for IP, data, units, solver behavior, rule packs, privacy, reports, and agent work. |
| [`docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`](../IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md) | Public/private content rules, provenance requirements, and quarantine process. |
| [`docs/SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) | Current technical architecture, domain objects, unit model, solver and rule-pack boundaries, reports, and V&V posture. |
| [`docs/TYPES.md`](../TYPES.md) | Canonical vocabulary for domain objects, statuses, diagnostics, rule packs, results, reports, and extension boundaries. |
| [`docs/VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md`](../VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md) | Benchmark families, release-quality evidence categories, and validation source rules. |
| [`docs/architecture/code_neutral_analysis_boundary.md`](../architecture/code_neutral_analysis_boundary.md) | Separation between mechanics solve authority, user-rule-check authority, and external human acceptance records. |
| [`docs/architecture/plugin_boundary.md`](../architecture/plugin_boundary.md) | API/plugin boundary rules, permissions, no-bypass constraints, checksums, and provenance expectations. |
| [`docs/architecture/extension_domain_contracts.md`](../architecture/extension_domain_contracts.md) | Domain rules for plugins and adapters that touch models, rule packs, diagnostics, reports, or results. |

Unresolved implementation choices remain `TBD` unless a human-approved
architecture or implementation deliverable records the decision. Current `TBD`
items include the production sparse solver library, rule expression grammar and
implementation library, dependency versions, CI thresholds, external transport,
plugin loading/isolation details, and physical project package format.

## 2. Architecture Map

OpenPipeStress is organized as a code-neutral workbench:

```text
GUI / UX Layer
  -> Application Services
       -> Domain Core
            -> Geometry + Units + Data Schemas
            -> Solver Core
            -> Loads + Stress Recovery
            -> Rule-Pack Evaluator
            -> Reporting / Audit Manifest
       -> Adapters
            -> Private Libraries
            -> Import / Export Plugins
            -> Local FEA Handoff
            -> Storage / Packaging
```

The domain core owns schema validation, unit and dimensional checks,
provenance checks, diagnostics, result envelopes, rule-pack sandbox controls,
and public/private data boundaries. Adapters and plugins translate data at the
boundary; they do not own the core validation policy and must not bypass it.

Schema-first JSON contracts are the public interchange baseline. The main
surfaces for solver and rule-pack work are:

- `schemas/model.schema.yaml` for canonical project and model structure;
- `schemas/units.schema.yaml` for unit-bearing quantities and dimension checks;
- `schemas/analysis_boundary.schema.yaml` and
  `schemas/analysis_status.schema.yaml` for status separation;
- `schemas/rule_pack.schema.yaml` for user-owned rule-pack structure;
- `schemas/results.schema.yaml` for result envelopes and downstream result
  exports;
- `api/api_boundary_contract.yaml` for command, query, job, and result-envelope
  boundaries;
- `schemas/plugin_manifest.schema.yaml` and
  `schemas/adapter_framework.schema.yaml` for governed extension surfaces.

When a contributor adds a new behavior, the implementation path should preserve
schema validation first, then units, provenance, privacy classification,
diagnostics, result envelopes, checksums, and report controls as applicable.

## 3. Solver Architecture

The solver side computes mechanics for a 3D centerline/frame analytical model.
Contributors should treat the schema-backed physical model as source-of-truth
input and derive solver-ready analytical objects through explicit, reviewable
transformations.

Expected solver concepts include:

- nodes with coordinates and six degree-of-freedom state semantics;
- elements connecting stable node references with material, section, optional
  component, local-coordinate, and result-station hooks;
- local/global orientation handling for element behavior;
- assembly, boundary-condition reduction, and solve execution behind the
  solver boundary;
- load application for explicit primitive loads, user loads, imposed
  displacements, and result-state algebra;
- stress recovery from mechanical resultants and user-supplied section or
  pressure inputs;
- deterministic diagnostics for missing inputs, unit mismatch, singular or
  invalid model state, convergence state, and unsupported behavior;
- nonlinear support active-state and nonconvergence reporting where applicable.

Existing implementation and module surfaces include:

| Surface | Contributor expectation |
|---|---|
| `core/solver/frame_kernel` | Keep frame mechanics deterministic and unit-compatible; sparse production solve policy remains `TBD`. |
| `core/solver/straight_pipe` | Adapt user-supplied pipe properties into the frame element boundary without supplying protected pipe tables or code-specific values. |
| `core/solver/linear_supports` | Map explicit support data to solver degrees of freedom without adding catalog defaults. |
| `core/solver/nonlinear_supports` | Report active-state and nonconvergence facts; do not hide unresolved nonlinear behavior. |
| `core/solver/diagnostics` | Emit stable diagnostics and statuses for solver facts and blocking conditions. |
| `core/solver/performance_harness` | Use invented or public-permissive fixtures with provenance for repeatability and regression evidence. |
| `core/loads/primitive_loads` and `core/loads/user_loads` | Prepare explicit load contributions; code-specific load combinations remain user/rule-pack supplied. |
| `core/loads/load_case_algebra` | Preserve unit and status intent for combinations, result-state subtraction, and ranges. |
| `core/loads/stress_recovery` | Recover open mechanics stress components only; do not add protected formulas, allowables, SIFs, flexibility factors, or public code-check logic. |

Missing solve-required data must become explicit findings, not silent defaults.
If a contribution needs protected formulas, protected tables, proprietary
commercial examples, private owner standards, or private project data, stop and
route the issue through the project data-boundary process.

## 4. Rule-Pack Architecture

Rule packs are user-owned, schema-governed artifacts. The public repository may
define the schema, lifecycle metadata, evaluator boundary, invented examples,
and tests. It must not bundle protected standards content, protected formulas,
material allowables, SIF/flexibility tables, protected dimensional tables,
private owner requirements, or proprietary catalog values as public defaults.

The rule-pack schema surface is `schemas/rule_pack.schema.yaml`. A valid
contributor-facing change should preserve these categories:

- identity, version, lifecycle status, and source notice;
- public/private classification and redistribution status;
- checksum metadata and canonical payload references where applicable;
- required input declarations with unit and dimension expectations;
- variables, formula declarations, value slots, and check definitions;
- diagnostic policy for missing inputs, unit mismatch, provenance gaps,
  redistribution gaps, protected-content suspicion, and evaluator errors;
- provenance and review status for public or contributed data;
- report notice and professional-boundary controls.

Rule-pack evaluation is declarative, sandboxed, deterministic, and unit-aware.
It cannot execute arbitrary host-language code, access the filesystem or
network, spawn processes, or bypass unit/provenance/privacy checks. The exact
expression grammar and evaluator implementation library remain `TBD` until a
sealed implementation deliverable and human-approved decision settle them.

Existing implementation surfaces include:

| Surface | Contributor expectation |
|---|---|
| `core/rules/expression_evaluator` | Evaluate declared expression structures with explicit variable bindings and dimension metadata only. |
| `core/rules/completeness_checker` | Compare required-input declarations against supplied evidence and emit rule-check-blocking findings when data is missing. |
| `core/rules/rule_pack_lifecycle` | Record privacy, redistribution, protected-content review, checksum, and lifecycle findings without exposing private formulas or values. |
| `examples/rule_packs/invented_demo.yaml` | Use only as an invented software demonstration pattern, not as engineering design guidance. |

`MECHANICS_SOLVED` means the mechanics result exists for the stated model and
evidence set. It does not mean a user rule check is complete. `USER_RULE_CHECKED`
and `USER_RULE_FAILED` are software computations using user-supplied rule-pack
data. `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` remains visible for professional use.

## 5. Data, Privacy, And Provenance

Every public data contribution that affects mechanics, rule checks, reports,
fixtures, examples, or libraries needs source, provenance, license or
redistribution status, contributor certification, and review disposition.

Public contribution candidates may include:

- open mechanics algorithms;
- blank schema slots and templates;
- invented non-engineering examples with clear notices;
- public-domain or permissively licensed data after review;
- original validation fixtures with documented provenance.

Public contribution candidates must not include:

- protected standards text, tables, figures, examples, or commentary;
- copied protected formulas or code-derived acceptance methods;
- material allowable tables copied from standards;
- protected SIF, flexibility-factor, dimensional, or rating tables;
- proprietary vendor catalogs without redistribution rights;
- commercial software benchmark files or report templates without permission;
- private project models, owner standards, company design bases, or private
  rule packs;
- real secrets, credentials, tokens, or private storage paths.

If protected or private content is suspected, stop ingestion, mark the content
as suspected or private as appropriate, quarantine it through the approved
process, and request human review. Do not paraphrase protected tables into
public examples and do not convert private values into public defaults.

## 6. Diagnostics And Result Envelopes

Solver, rule-pack, report, and adapter outputs should expose structured
diagnostics rather than hiding uncertainty. Diagnostics should identify the
source, severity, affected object, remediation path, provenance where relevant,
and whether the finding blocks a solve, blocks a user-rule check, warns about
privacy/provenance/IP risk, or records an unsupported `TBD`.

Result envelopes should preserve:

- schema version and solver or evaluator version where available;
- model, input, run, and result references;
- unit-aware result values;
- analysis statuses and user-rule statuses without collapsing them into one
  outcome;
- diagnostics, warnings, assumptions, and limitations;
- rule-pack references by ID, version, checksum, source notice, and
  redistribution status;
- reproducibility and checksum metadata.

Reports and exports may reference private rule-pack identity, version, checksum,
and source notes without exposing private formulas or protected values in public
templates.

## 7. Test Discipline

Solver and rule-pack changes need deterministic evidence before release use.
The required evidence depends on the touched surface:

| Change area | Evidence expected |
|---|---|
| Units and schemas | Schema validation tests, dimension checks, invalid unit rejection, and round-trip behavior where applicable. |
| Frame mechanics | Deterministic mechanics benchmarks using original, public-domain, or permissively licensed fixtures. |
| Loads and stress recovery | Regression tests for explicit load application, result-state algebra, and open mechanics stress components. |
| Nonlinear supports | Active-state traces, convergence or nonconvergence diagnostics, and repeatable unresolved-state reporting. |
| Rule packs | Required-input checks, unit mismatch tests, unsafe-expression rejection, invented-example tests, checksum/lifecycle checks, and privacy/provenance findings. |
| Reports and exports | Reproducibility, checksum stability, warning inclusion, privacy filtering, and protected-content lint coverage. |
| Adapters and plugins | No-bypass tests for schema validation, units, provenance, privacy, protected-content screening, diagnostics, result envelopes, and sandboxed rule-pack access. |

Validation fixtures and public examples must be original, public-domain, or
permissively licensed with review evidence. Mechanics verification and workflow
validation support engineering review; they do not replace project-specific
human judgment.

## 8. Contribution Checklist

Before proposing a solver, rule-pack, report, or adapter change, verify:

- the change stays inside the assigned deliverable scope and write scope;
- affected schemas, modules, docs, and tests use current project vocabulary;
- unit-bearing values carry explicit units and dimensions;
- missing solve-required or rule-check-required values emit diagnostics;
- provenance, redistribution status, review status, and public/private markers
  are preserved;
- rule-pack evaluation remains sandboxed and deterministic;
- public docs, fixtures, examples, and tests contain no protected standards
  content, proprietary commercial examples, private project data, or real
  secrets;
- unresolved choices are labeled `TBD`;
- inferred statements are labeled `ASSUMPTION` and proposed future behavior is
  labeled `PROPOSAL`;
- result and report wording keeps mechanics results, user-rule checks, and
  external human review separate.

Agent outputs, generated artifacts, and software results remain drafts or
decision-support records until accepted by the appropriate human project gate.
