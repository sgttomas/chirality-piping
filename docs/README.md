# OpenPipeStress Agentic Development Docs

This `docs/` package is a seed governance and decomposition set for agentic development of **OpenPipeStress**: a free and open-source, code-neutral piping flexibility and stress-analysis platform.

The central project stance is:

> **Open the mechanics; protect the standards; empower the engineer.**

This package is written from the perspective of `SOFTWARE_DECOMP`: it converts the product intent and PRD into a structured, flat package/deliverable decomposition suitable for downstream agent execution.

## Document map

| File | Role | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `../INIT.md` | Bootstrap | Required reading order and agent startup constraints; maintained only at the repository root. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent index | Project-specific use of Chirality agent roles. |
| `INTENT.md` | Directional intent | Why this product exists and what must remain true. |
| `PRD.md` | Product requirements | Product capabilities, users, non-goals, and release strategy. |
| `DIRECTIVE.md` | Founding directive | Design philosophy, professional boundary, stop rules, and scope constraints. |
| `TYPES.md` | Vocabulary and identity | Canonical terms, IDs, statuses, and software/piping domain types. |
| `CONTRACT.md` | Invariant catalog | Binding project invariants for legal/data boundary, solver, rule packs, reports, and agents. |
| `SPEC.md` | Technical specification | Architecture, schemas, solver mechanics, GUI, reports, V&V, and agentic execution mechanics. |
| `IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` | Data/IP policy | Public/private data rules, contributor certification, provenance, and quarantine policy. |
| `VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md` | Verification and validation | Benchmark and release-quality strategy. |
| `AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` | Agent workflow | How Type 1/Type 2 agents should consume this package and produce deliverables. |
| `_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` | Working surface | SSOW, objectives, packages, deliverables, scope ledger summary, telemetry, open issues. |
| `_Registers/ScopeLedger.csv` | Authoritative companion register | Machine-readable scope-to-package/deliverable mapping. |
| `_Registers/Deliverables.csv` | Authoritative companion register | Machine-readable deliverable catalog. |
| `_Registers/ContextBudgetQA.csv` | Authoritative companion register | Context-envelope and sizing audit. |

## Status

This package is the **v0.3 current downstream decomposition basis** for agentic preparation and sealed deliverable execution. Revision v0.3 adds `PKG-00 — Software Architecture Runway` as the first architecture gate before package-level implementation planning proceeds. It is not an approved engineering work product, not a legal opinion, and not a claim of code compliance.

## How agents should use this package

1. Start from the root `INIT.md`, then read `DIRECTIVE.md`, `CONTRACT.md`, `TYPES.md`, and `SPEC.md` before writing code.
2. Use `_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` as the authoritative working surface for packages and deliverables.
3. Use `_Registers/*.csv` for machine-checkable mappings.
4. Treat every deliverable as bounded: no agent may expand scope silently.
5. Unknown values become `TBD`; suspected protected data is quarantined and escalated.
6. Generated outputs remain drafts until a human accepts them at the appropriate gate.

## Foundational references used to create this package

- Conversation intent captured in `INTENT.md`.
- Product requirements captured in `PRD.md`.
- Chirality bootstrap and agent framework examples supplied by the user.
- M. W. Kellogg, *Design of Piping Systems* (1956), as a historical technical reference for classical piping flexibility analysis.
