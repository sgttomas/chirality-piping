# Procedure: DEL-00-02 Repository and module boundary architecture

## Purpose
Execute and review this deliverable-local architecture document kit without crossing the PKG-00 boundary.

## Prerequisites
- Root bootstrap and governance documents have been read.
- `docs/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.3 is the current basis.
- Coordination mode remains Full DAG with DAG authoring deferred.
- Blocker computation remains disabled until a human-approved acyclic DAG exists.

## Execution Steps
1. Inventory the architecture layers named in SPEC and the PKG-00 scope items.
2. Map each layer to responsibilities, allowed dependencies, and forbidden bypasses.
3. Identify unresolved implementation-layout choices as TBD and route them to the ADR baseline.
4. Check the boundary map against the IP/data, unit-safety, and professional-authority invariants.
5. Prepare the module-boundary package for human architecture review.

## Verification Checks
- Confirm the deliverable path is inside `execution/PKG-00_Software Architecture Runway/`.
- Confirm `_CONTEXT.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, and `_SEMANTIC.md` exist.
- Confirm document-kit content maps to the scope items in `_CONTEXT.md`.
- Confirm no PKG-01 through PKG-12 files are modified.
- Confirm protected-content and professional-authority guardrails are stated.
- Confirm unresolved decisions are visible as `TBD`.

## Records to Preserve
- `Datasheet.md`
- `Specification.md`
- `Guidance.md`
- `Procedure.md`
- `_SEMANTIC.md`
- `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`
- `_run_records/TASK_RUN_*.md`
- `_STATUS.md`

## Completion Condition
This deliverable is ready for human architecture review when the document kit exists, semantic artifacts exist, lifecycle state is `SEMANTIC_READY`, and all unresolved architecture decisions are visible rather than silently resolved.
