# MEMORY - DEL-08-01 Calculation Report Generator

## Implementation Record

2026-05-02:

- Implemented a bounded calculation-report contract under
  `schemas/report_generator.schema.yaml`.
- Added `core/reporting/report_generator/` as a standalone Rust support crate
  for in-memory report validation, template-slot validation, and deterministic
  neutral section ordering.
- Added an invented, non-engineering report fixture under
  `fixtures/reports/invented/calculation_report_fixture.json`.
- Added `tests/test_report_generator_contract.py` for stdlib schema and
  fixture checks.
- Updated `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/TYPES.md` with the report-generator
  boundary.

## Source Basis

- Sealed dispatch brief:
  `execution/_Coordination/DEV-001_DISPATCH_DEL-08-01.md`.
- Deliverable context:
  `execution/PKG-08_Reporting, Audit, and Reproducibility/1_Working/DEL-08-01_Calculation report generator/_CONTEXT.md`.
- Active upstreams preserved:
  `DEL-02-05`, `DEL-05-03`, `DEL-05-04`, `DEL-06-04`, `DEL-08-02`,
  `DEL-08-03`, and `DEL-01-04`.

## Guardrails Preserved

- No protected standards text, protected tables, protected examples,
  proprietary formulas, proprietary engineering values, private project data,
  private rule-pack payloads, private library content, or real secrets were
  introduced.
- No GUI presentation, CLI runtime, API transport, adapter behavior, local FEA
  handoff packaging, protected-content linter implementation, private-data
  redaction/export controls, package/CI/release change, lifecycle transition,
  dependency-register edit, evidence registration, blocker-queue refresh, or
  candidate-edge change was performed.
- Report output remains decision support and preserves human-review-required
  status without automatic code-compliance, certification, sealing, approval,
  authentication, endorsement, or professional-reliance claims.

## Verification

Run before closeout:

- `python3 tests/test_report_generator_contract.py`
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path core/reporting/report_generator/Cargo.toml -- --check`
- `cargo test --manifest-path core/reporting/report_generator/Cargo.toml`
- `python3 tests/test_report_sections_contract.py`
- `python3 tests/test_results_schema.py`
- `python3 tests/test_analysis_status_schema.py`
- `python3 tests/test_persistence_schema.py`
- `python3 tests/test_rule_pack_schema.py`
- `git diff --check`

## Remaining TBDs

- GUI presentation and report preview workflow.
- CLI runtime and command syntax.
- Public API transport.
- Adapter behavior.
- Private-data redaction/export controls.
- Protected-content linter integration.
- Release-template integration.
- Final report styling/layout policy.
