# MEMORY - DEL-11-05 Contributor tutorial and onboarding

## 2026-05-09 Type 2 Implementation

Worker DEL-11-05 implemented the bounded contributor onboarding documentation
requested by `execution/_Coordination/DEV-001_REV05_SEALED_BRIEF_DEL-11-05.md`.

Implemented artifacts:

- `docs/contributor_guide/index.md` as the contributor-facing tutorial path.
- A narrow onboarding link in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- A narrow workflow-reference link in `docs/AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`.

Boundary notes:

- No lifecycle `_STATUS.md`, dependency register, coordination surface,
  blocker queue, aggregate DAG, candidate row, release authority, maintainer
  authority, or legal-mechanism artifact was edited.
- The local `_CONTEXT.md` still references revision 0.4, but this run used the
  sealed brief's revision 0.5 dispatch basis and recorded the mismatch in the
  guide as a contributor handoff concern.
- The guide intentionally preserves existing `TBD` decisions for license,
  contributor mechanism, release authority, CI policy, dependency versions,
  and human-governed decisions.
- The guide is tutorial documentation only. It does not create professional
  engineering approval, sealing, code-compliance, legal, release, or maintainer
  authority.

Verification summary:

- Documentation path/link check run with a local Python markdown-link scanner.
- Focused scans run for protected-content, private-data,
  proprietary-example, real-secret marker, authority drift, and
  professional/code-compliance claim language.
- `git diff --check` run.
