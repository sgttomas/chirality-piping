# DEV-001 Implementation-Readiness Blocker Queue

This blocker queue is an advisory implementation-readiness view only. It is not a schedule, staffing plan, priority list, lifecycle approval, professional approval, or readiness-for-reliance claim.

## Computation Rule

- Source graph: `execution/_DAG/DAG-002/DependencyEdges.csv`.
- Included edges: `Status=ACTIVE` only.
- Excluded edges: all `Status=CANDIDATE` rows.
- Direction convention: `FromDeliverableID` is the downstream consumer and is blocked by `TargetDeliverableID`, the upstream provider.
- Satisfaction threshold: upstream provider has `COMMITTED` evidence in `execution/_Coordination/DEV-001_IMPLEMENTATION_EVIDENCE.csv`.
- `SEMANTIC_READY` remains decomposition/context readiness evidence; it does not satisfy implementation blockers by itself.
- `PKG-00` `ARCHITECTURE_BASIS` provider edges are satisfied by the accepted architecture baseline, not by implementation evidence.
- `UNBLOCKED` means all active upstream implementation dependencies satisfy the threshold or are satisfied architecture-basis edges.
- `BLOCKED` means one or more active upstream providers lack committed implementation evidence.

## Unblocked DAG-Ready Items

These deliverables have no active upstream implementation dependency below the `COMMITTED` threshold. Items without their own committed evidence are DAG-ready candidates, not completed work.

## Blocked Items Grouped By Missing Upstream

No blocked items were found under the implementation-readiness threshold.

## Per-Deliverable Blocked Items

No per-deliverable implementation blockers were found.

## Candidate Edges Excluded

Candidate edges remain non-gating pending later `RECONCILIATION` and `CHANGE`; they were not used in the blocker state calculation.

## Machine-Readable Queue

Full per-deliverable queue rows are recorded in `execution/_Coordination/DEV-001_BLOCKER_QUEUE.csv`.
